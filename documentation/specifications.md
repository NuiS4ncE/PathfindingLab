# Specifications 

The project is a lab work for the University of Helsinki's data structures and PathfindingLab.ui.algorithms lab course. The topic is pathfinding and different data structures and PathfindingLab.ui.algorithms will be used. Used language is English and the course is part of the bachelor's in science degree in computer science. 

# Data structures and PathfindingLab.ui.algorithms 

Algorithms used in the project will be Dijkstra's Shortest Path First algorithm, A-star search algorithm and jump point search algorithm. Different data structures will be used, most common one with each is the priority queue. 
Maps from the Moving AI Lab will be used as input. 

# Time and space complexity 

Time complexity for the Dijkstra's algorithm will be O(V^2). A-star search algorithm's path selection is through cost by f(n) = g(n) + h(n), where g(n) is the cost of the path from the start node to n and h(n) is a heuristic function to estimate the cost of the cheapest path from n to the goal. Jump point search is an optimization of the A-star search algorithm and is expected to be faster than the A-star search algorithm.
