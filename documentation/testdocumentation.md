# Test document

Testing is done by JUnit testing in the `test` folder. 

## Test inputs

Tests are run with test inputs that are generated within the test files. <br>
DijkstraPathTest has a smaller and a bigger two dimensional array as an input for the route. Start and end coordinates are set up before tests.

## Test commands

Tests can be run with the command `./gradlew test` or `gradle test` depending on the version of gradle you're running.
