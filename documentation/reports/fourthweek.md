# Fourth week

This week I fixed the GUI finally by changing from StackPane to BorderPane. I also got rid of ImageView and replaced it by GraphicsContext and a canvas. The coordinates should be now in accordance with the size of the image. Also finding and opening different maps from the directory is now available. 
The part where I'm still stuck is the Dijkstra. What I don't understand is the distance. How do I get the distance between two coordinates and how can I navigate it, if all nodes (pixels) are of the same distance from each other? 
I'm not on time with the course schedule, so I have to try to work more on the project in the coming week. Next up I have to finish Dijkstra, make it run with the maps and be able to draw it. 

Time spent on the project this week was 10h.
