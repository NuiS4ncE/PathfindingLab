# Second week

This week I tried to do some configurations on the project. I started with the GUI instead of going straight to the algorithms. The idea was
to be able to visualize and understand what kind of data the algorithms will handle. 
So far the creation of the GUI has been somewhat unsuccessful. 
I've learned once again that JavaFX is a pain in the ass. 
Also the configuration with codecov, checkstyle and JavaFX Gradle plugin caused some trouble and had to be debugged for hours. 
Unfortunately I didn't manage my time well and hadn't completed as much as I wanted to. 
Testing is non-existent right now and javadoc is missing.

Next up is to make at least a skeleton of the algorithms. The idea is to use the 
color values of adjacent pixels and use them as nodes.

Time spent on the project this week was around 10h.
