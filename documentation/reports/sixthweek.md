# Sixth week 

This week I finished Dijkstra and started A-star properly. A-star just needs a finishing touch and I can move to the data structures and jump point search. 
I got stuck on Dijkstra and couldn't move on to A-star because of a stupid mistake in the movementChecks-method. I mixed up two integer variables, moveX and moveY with movementX and movementY, and it halted progress for a day. 
</br>
I added the possibility to choose the algorithm you want to use in the GUI and did some fixes to problems that were pointed out in the peer review this week. 
</br>
I learned more about the optimization of algorithms and about how the heuristics of A-star work. 
</br>
Next up is the finishing of A-star, making the heap and starting and hopefully finishing the jump point search. The jump point search is going to be a tough one.

Time spent on the project this week was 16h.
