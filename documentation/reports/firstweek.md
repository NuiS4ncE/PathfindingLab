# First week 

This week was handling and writing of the documentation and trying to plan the project ahead. So far the project has gone forward only through the writing of documentation. 
This week I learned that the project will be a complicated one and it's gonna require a lot of work. The data structures and algorithms course didn't go that well for me last year and I've tried to practice algorithms on my free time with programming languages other than Java, but I'm a bit dreaded by the upcoming task. I'm not completely clear on everything that will be included in the writing of algorithms and data structures. That's also probably because of starting the planning itself a bit too late before the deadline this week. 

Next up is the writing of the code, the algorithms and data structures and required testing, and trying to churn out something intelligible. Since the maps are in graphical form some kind of GUI should be planned out. 

Time spent on project this week was around 6 hours.
