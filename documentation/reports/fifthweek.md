# Fifth week

This week I somewhat finished Dijkstra. There's still some issues either on the drawing side or the algorithm itself, so it need to be polished. </br>
I also started making JUnit tests and started the test documentation and did a peer review on another project. 
</br>
Next up I'll start the heap and the A-star algorithm.
</br></br>
Time spent on the project this week was 8h + 2h + 10,5h = 20,5h.
