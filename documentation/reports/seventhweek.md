# Seventh week

This week I didn't get that much or enough work done. A-star and Dijkstra work with PriorityQueue now, but unfortunately the heap of my own
making isn't working yet and I got stuck. Confusing 
</br>
I've learned that minimum heaps can be difficult and different and varying tests are useful, because some test input maps might pass while others will not. 
<br>
Next up I'm moving after the heap to IDA* algorithm and replacing JPS by it.

Time spent on the project this week was 15h.
