# Third week

This week I started working on the Dijkstra algorithm and tried to extend the GUI. I tried to create the GUI using a different library, but had to revert back to the old one. I learned that the image pixels should be either converted to 0 and 1 values or I can use just the RGB-values. 
I ran into problems with the GUI with StackPane especially. The X and Y coordinates are bigger than refitted image size causing array index out of bounds problems. Don't know how to fix that yet. 
The StackPane hasn't shown to be effective for drawing on images and it seems the image can't be drawn on. I don't have a solution for that either. 
Next up I hope to finish Dijkstra, get it working with GUI and also start on the A-star algorithm. 

Time spent on the project this week was 10h.
